## Sample Letter of Motivation for Bachelors Degree

[For a Nepali student who wish to study B.Sc. Business and Management Studies at University of Europe for Applied Sciences, Germany]

Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Business and Management Studies at the University of Europe for Applied Sciences in Germany. As a Nepali student with a passion for business and management, I am excited about the opportunity to study in Germany and gain the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in a global business environment.

Growing up in Nepal, I have always been fascinated by the world of business and entrepreneurship. From a young age, I observed my parents run their small business with hard work and dedication, and I was inspired by their success. As I grew older, I realized that I also had a passion for business and decided to pursue a career in this field.

After completing my high school education, I enrolled in a local college, where I studied Business Administration for two years. During this time, I learned about the fundamentals of business management, marketing, finance, and accounting. However, I realized that I needed to broaden my knowledge and skills to succeed in the global market. That is why I am eager to continue my studies at the University of Europe for Applied Sciences.

I am specifically interested in studying at your university because of the reputation it has for providing excellent education in business and management studies. Your university has a strong focus on practical training, which I believe will be valuable in helping me develop the skills needed to succeed in a competitive business environment. Moreover, the opportunity to study in Germany will enable me to learn about different cultures, and it will broaden my perspective on global business practices.

Furthermore, I am impressed by the program curriculum, which offers a broad range of courses that cover all aspects of business management. The program emphasizes innovation, entrepreneurship, and sustainability, which I believe are essential components of a successful business. The opportunity to engage in internships and industry projects will also provide me with valuable experience and insight into the professional world.

As a Nepali student, I believe that I can contribute to the diverse and vibrant community at the University of Europe for Applied Sciences. I am fluent in Nepali, English, and Hindi, and I have experience working in multicultural environments. I am eager to learn from my classmates and to share my perspectives and experiences with them.

In addition, I have been involved in various extracurricular activities that have helped me develop my leadership and organizational skills. I have served as the President of my collegeâ€™s Business Club, where I organized events and workshops to promote business education among my peers. I have also volunteered at local NGOs, where I have gained experience in project management and social entrepreneurship.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude for your consideration of my application. I am committed to working hard and contributing positively to the University of Europe for Applied Sciences community. I believe that my academic background, extracurricular activities, and passion for business and management studies make me a strong candidate for the Bachelor of Science in Business and Management Studies program.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
