Salutation: 

    Dear ika Admission Committee,


Introduction: Introducing yourself, briefly state the most significant credential or the most relevant detail before moving to The Statement of Goal (Thesis statement) -> The most important sentence in the letter.

    I am Maria Rodriguez, a recent university graduate from Colombia, and I would like to apply for admission to your M.Sc. Automotive Engineering program. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the National University of Colombia Bogota (UNAL) with a GPA of 3.3/4(German equivalent: 1.5) in June 2021, and am now looking to take the next step in my academic career with a master's degree. I believe my deep educational and work experience in engineering and automotive disciplines makes me a strong candidate for this program, and that this M.Sc. program will propel me towards my goal of working as an automotive engineer at a top German automobile manufacture (e.g., BMW Munich)

Body: 

    Deeper into Educational and other Qualifications, it is expand upon the CV -> details and richness information that the Reader have over the CV. Also narrative details to the Qualities.

* Qualifications: 

    I have through my undergraduate courses, extracurricular activities and internships gathered extensive knowledge of automotive topics. I ranked among the top students in my major concentration, "manufacturing processes", which focused heavily on assuring maximally efficient production while also transitioning to more efficient and environmentally-friendly manufacturing processes. I supplemented my formal studies by taking a leading role in my university's robotics club (UNRobot), which went above and beyond my courses in giving me a deep fundamental understanding or robotics. I also made sure to take all available courses in English in order to refine my technical vocabulary and ensure that language will be no barrier in my English-taught graduate courses.

* Why this program? 

        Make the LoM for each program differ
        -> let the reader know that you already research about the program you are applying for. How you can benefit from the program professionally and, or personally, and take the program seriously.
    What makes RWTH's Automotive Engineering program particularly appealing to me is the fact that its modules strike a brilliant balance between practice and theory. This M.Sc. program will contribute greatly to my expertise in the field, significantly strengthening my grasp of the subject. I would particularly look forward to taking the courses "Structural Design of Vehicles" (which would build upon my internship experience while adding a new angle through its focus on passive safety), and "Environmental Sustainability in Transport Engineering" (providing a deeper look into Mr.Backes' and my own area of interest, optimizing energy management). These courses, among others, would help me build a solid foundation for a future career in eco-friendly and forward-thinking automobile manufacturing.



Conclusion:

    Thank you for your consideration, and for the opportunity of applying to this program. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

    Sincerely,

    Maria S. C.
