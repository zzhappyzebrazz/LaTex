% Introduction, teaser and Statement of Goal
I'm a software engineer based in Ho Chi Minh city Vietnam with over three years of experience working on various Telecommunications projects, including IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and 5G-core system. I'm writing this letter to apply for admission to your M.Sc. Electrical Communication Engineering (ECE) program. I have completed a B.Eng. in Electronics - Telecommunications from Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology (VNU-HCMUT) with a GPA of 7.29/10 (German equivalent: 2.63) in November 2021, and am now eager to advance my career by pursuing a master's degree closely aligned with professional expertise. 
Through the years, I have gained a solid technical foundation and invaluable experience from working on projects with global leaders in Telecommunications, such as Ericsson (Sweden) and Viettel (Vietnam)--the most valuable Telecoms brand in Southeast Asia. I believe this combination of academic and professional experience makes me a strong candidate for your program.

% Talk about my unique qualification, experience working in the Telco company such as Ericsson, Viettel
% 

% Body of the letter is about knowledge and skills (in bachelor degree?) or relevant professional experience, other relevant skills
% Begin with a topic sentence
% make sure to mention previous degree and courses e.g. academic performance, major & specializations projects
% relevant work experience: internship, trainings
% further important skill: language, computer
% Stick to the order: education -> work experience -> skills
% Do not skip over your educational background too quickly
% Qualifications
I have gained an extensive amount of understanding in the broad subject of electronics and telecommunications through my undergraduate courses, extracurricular activities, and thesis project. In my third year, with only a GPA of 7/10 at the time, I was able to convince the recruiter that I am a promising engineer and got offered a 6-month paid internship from Intel Products Vietnam. I was the only student in my program that got accepted.
%  During my internship, I learned how a modern CPU is manufactured, and finished my internship with a Machine learning project which can detect debris or foreign materials on CPU unit with the model confidence was above 80\% for each prediction. 
 % Talk about how I obtain the IELTS certificate in a 3 months self study while on my job
  % and express that I could extend my language learning ability by try hard in German, and received a A2 CERT and then got a B1 after study in German
I also aced all of my university English classes, and during my full-time job, with just 3 months of intensive preparation, I achieved a C1 Advanced level of English user certificate. This could be a boost for my confidence when trying to learn German as my third language.

Not to mention, the most important is my current professional job in telecommunication field of mobile network system. I started my career with a strong foundation in an Ericsson project that built a solid background in engineering. The process of troubleshooting, engineering reasoning and also how to express the difficult technical problem to other colleague is as important as a competent engineer. After a year and a half working on the Core Session Control Function in IMS project, I go on and join one of the most important Telecommunication project in my country, building the first 5G-core stand alone system for Viettel, the largest mobile operator in Vietnam. The project on-air on the 20th of November 2024, serving more than 3 million user on its initiative.

% what it helps you to accomplished 
% getting your dream job, field of work, specific knowledge

For the rising queries regarding of the ECE program, from the flyer of the ECE at glance, it caught my attention on the Wireless Communication research which mention about the latest mobile connectivity such as 5G, 6G and potential non-terrestrial (satellite) communication. Also the Enabling Technologies for Communication Systems section which depict Mobile Network technology or the future of autonomous network. The module handbook also going to detail about some of the courses such Introduction to Information Security, which I found extremely useful for student from country with the infamous of internet fraud like Vietnam to understand and study some of the regulation from European such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

A part from the ECE programme, studying in the home of European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) a member of the 3GPP group that in charge of the Technical Specification (TS) of all the Telecommunication Generation from 3G up to 5G, and 6G in a close future, could help me have a deeper understanding and unwind the questions I have during my working time analysis of the those specifications. For the last mention, an invitation to play this game of life, to see how far I could go, to you how youth turn out to be.

% Conclusion
Thank you for your consideration, and for the opportunity of applying to this program. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
